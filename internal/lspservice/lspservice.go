// Package lspservice holds the LSP session state for one open buffer —
// which server is running, what document/version it thinks it has open, and
// what it advertised during initialize — plus the small behaviors that only
// ever need those fields to decide anything (is a session active, is this
// async result stale, bump the version and notify). It has zero dependency
// on piecetable, offset, or Editor: everything it needs to reason about
// itself lives on the type, which is exactly what let it split cleanly out
// of internal/editor (see BACKLOG.md's 2026-09-24 architecture review) —
// first bundled into one Editor field instead of six scattered ones, then
// given its own methods so Editor stopped reaching into its fields
// directly, then moved here once that was true.
//
// Editor (internal/editor) is the only caller today: it owns one Service
// per buffer, calls Start/Reopen/Reset as the active file/language changes,
// and DidChange/DidOpen/NextCompletionGeneration from its own locked
// methods. Nothing here takes a lock itself — Editor's own mutex already
// serializes every call into a Service, the same way it serializes every
// other piece of its state.
