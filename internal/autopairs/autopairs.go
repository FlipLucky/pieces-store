// Package autopairs decides what should happen when a bracket or quote
// character is typed next to existing text — auto-close, skip-over an
// already-inserted closer, or just insert plainly. Pure decision logic: it
// only ever sees the rune being typed and its immediate neighbors, never a
// buffer, a cursor, or an Editor. The caller (internal/editor) is the
// imperative shell that reads the decision and actually mutates the
// buffer — see BACKLOG.md's 2026-09-24 architecture review for why this
// split exists.

// whether to pair at all needs a heuristic (see shouldPairQuote): only
// when neither neighboring character is a word character. Without that,
// typing the apostrophe in a contraction like "don" + "t" would insert a
// matching close right after it instead of just the one character, and
// typing a quote right before an existing word would split it in two.
