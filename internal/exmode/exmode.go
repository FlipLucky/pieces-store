// Package exmode parses command-mode input (":w somefile", ":LspInstall
// go") into a resolved Command — vim's own term for these is "Ex commands,"
// from the : prompt inherited from the ex editor, hence the package name.
//
// Deliberately not an extension of internal/keyengine, even though the
// idea is the same ("keystrokes/text in, a resolved command out, never
// acted on here"): keyengine's ExecutableCommand{Count,Verb,Modifier,Noun}
// shape is built specifically for vim's verb/modifier/noun grammar, and
// command-mode text isn't that grammar at all — it's flat, space-separated
// tokens, closer to a shell command line. Forcing it into keyengine's types
// would be a conceptual mismatch, not a simplification. See BACKLOG.md's
// 2026-09-24 architecture review for the reasoning.
//
// Like keyengine, this package only ever resolves — it has zero dependency
// on piecetable, lspclient, or Editor, and never mutates anything. Editor's
// own command dispatcher (executeCommandLocked) does exactly what
// dispatch.go's execute() already does for keyengine's output: take the
// resolved Command, call the right Editor method.

// Command is one parsed command-mode invocation — Name is the first token
// (case-sensitive; ":LspInstall" and ":lspinstall" are different commands
// today, matching the existing convention), Args is everything after it,
// whitespace-tokenized. Raw is that same remainder *without* tokenization,
// exactly as typed (only leading/trailing whitespace trimmed) — needed by
// commands whose argument shape isn't space-separated tokens at all, like
// :s/pattern/replacement/flags, where either side of the delimiter may
// itself contain spaces. WholeBuffer is true when the command was prefixed
// with "%" (e.g. :%s///) — a deliberately minimal range system: just
// "current line" (the default, matching real vim) vs. "whole buffer,"
// not arbitrary N,M line ranges.
//

// followed immediately by Enter — which callers should treat as a no-op,
