// TestMain isolates every test in this package from the real machine's
// cache/config directories before anything else runs. Necessary because
// opening any real file with a supported Language (NewEditorFromFile,
// OpenFile, :e — used pervasively across this package's tests) now
// triggers ensureLSPForCurrentBufferLocked (lsp.go), which resolves an
// installed server via platform.LSPServersDir() — real os.UserCacheDir()
// unless overridden. Without this, a plain `go test ./...` would create
// ~/.cache/pieces-store on the real machine as a side effect of testing
// (confirmed happening before this was added), and on a machine that
// already has a real gopls installed via :LspInstall, would actually spawn
// it in the background during every test that opens a .go file. A
// package-wide TestMain isolates this once, rather than needing every
// individual test that touches a real file to remember to do it.
