# Features

What the editor actually does, where that came from, and where it's going.
This is the product view — for engineering-log-style tracking of specific
known bugs/gaps, see `CLAUDE.md`'s Known Issues and `BACKLOG.md` instead.

## Present — what works today

**Core editing** (via `internal/piecetable`, a piece-table buffer):
- Insert, delete, undo, and redo, all backed by a real piece-table
  implementation rather than a naive string buffer.
- Undo/redo report the precise byte-range delta of each edit, not just "the
  buffer changed" — the piece that made real syntax highlighting possible
  without re-parsing the whole file on every keystroke.
- Open and save text files, with unsaved-changes protection (`:q` refuses
  to quit with unsaved edits; `:q!` discards them deliberately).

**Vim-style modal editing** (via `internal/keyengine` + `internal/offset`),
with full GUI/TUI parity — both front ends route through the identical
engine, not just one of them:
- Modes: Normal, Insert, Command (Visual mode exists as a concept but has
  no keybindings wired to it yet — see Future).
- Cursor motion: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` and the arrow keys (Normal mode; arrow
  keys also move the cursor in Insert mode), plus `w`/`b`/`e` (word
  forward/backward/end), all with count prefixes (`3l`, `2w`).
- Text objects: `diw` (delete inner word), `daw` (delete around word,
  including trailing whitespace), `dip` (delete inner paragraph).
- Line operations: `dd` (delete line), `o` / `O` (open a new line
  below/above, auto-indented — see below — and enter Insert mode).
- Undo / redo: `u` / `Ctrl-r`.
- Replace: `r` swaps the character under the cursor for the next keystroke.
- Yank, delete, change, and paste (`y`/`d`/`c`/`p`/`P`), including
  bare-motion short deletes (`dw`, `db`, `de`, `dh`, `dl`, plus `x` as a
  direct alias for `dl`) and counted operators (`3diw`) — all backed by a
  real clipboard register: category registers for yank/delete/visual (up
  to 9 recent entries each), an unnamed default register every yank/delete
  feeds, and lowercase named registers (`"ayw`, `"ap`) — uppercase
  append-registers are a deliberate omission, not a gap.
- `:register`/`:registers` — a docked bottom-panel overview of every
  register's current contents, nvim's own convention over a cursor-
  anchored popup.
- Line numbers: `:set number`/`:set relativenumber`, real vim's own
  independent options rather than one three-way toggle — combine both for
  the familiar "hybrid" gutter (absolute on the current line, relative
  everywhere else).
- Command mode: `:w [file]`, `:e file`, `:q`/`:q!`, `:wq`, `:set`, with
  vim-wildmenu-style path completion — `<Tab>` starts/confirms a candidate
  (descending into directories), `<C-n>`/`<C-p>` browse the list — and
  command-*name* completion the same way (`:Lsp<Tab>` cycles `LspInstall`/
  `LspStatus`/`LspUninstall` before any argument is typed).
- Auto-closing brackets and quotes in Insert mode: typing `{`/`(`/`[`
  inserts the matching close too, cursor landing between them; typing the
  closing bracket yourself skips over the auto-inserted one instead of
  doubling up; backspace collapses an empty pair in one step. `"`/`'`/`` ` ``
  get the same treatment, but only pair when neither neighboring character
  is a word character — so typing a contraction like `don't` doesn't
  trigger an unwanted auto-pair on the apostrophe.

**Real syntax highlighting** (`internal/syntax`, added 2026-09-19) for a
curated 15-language set: Go, TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS,
PHP, Dart, C, C++, YAML, JSON, Dockerfile, Markdown. Built on a pure-Go
tree-sitter runtime (no C toolchain needed to build or run this editor, on
any platform — including a working WASM build, chosen specifically to
keep the door open for a future web target). Updates incrementally as you
type rather than re-parsing the whole file.

**Real auto-indent** (also `internal/syntax`, same day): opening a new line
(`o`/`O`) or pressing `<Enter>` mid-line indents to match the actual
syntax-tree nesting at that point — not a brace-counting heuristic, which
would misfire on a `{`/`}` sitting inside a string or comment.

**Real find & replace** (`:s///` and `:%s///`, added 2026-10-17): the `g`
flag (all matches per line, not just the first) and the `c` (confirm) flag
(walks each match asking y/n/a/q/l, nvim's own real semantics) both work;
case-override flags (`i`/`I`) don't yet. Matches highlight live while a
substitute command is still being typed — nvim's own "inccommand" preview
— narrowing progressively as the pattern grows, before any closing
delimiter exists.

**Delivery**: a terminal UI (`tview`/`tcell`) and a GUI (`Gio`), sharing the
same `Editor` core, both windowed/viewport-bounded rather than redrawing
the whole document on every keystroke, both showing the same syntax
highlighting, both with a block cursor in Normal/Visual/Command mode and a
pipe/bar cursor in Insert mode — the terminal UI drives the terminal's own
real native cursor for this (not a color-inversion simulation), genuinely
changing shape rather than approximating it.

**A real language server installer/manager** (`:LspInstall`/
`:LspUninstall`/`:LspStatus`, added 2026-09-20), the first half of real LSP
support: installs an actual language server for any of the curated
languages, sourced from the same live `mason-registry` data Neovim's Mason
plugin uses — Go (`gopls`), TypeScript/JavaScript/TSX
(`typescript-language-server`), HTML/CSS/SCSS/JSON
(`vscode-langservers-extracted`), PHP (`intelephense`), YAML
(`yaml-language-server`), C/C++ (`clangd`), Markdown (`marksman`),
Dockerfile (`docker-language-server`), and Dart (detected on `PATH` — it
ships with its own SDK). Installs run in the background — the editor stays
responsive while a server downloads — with progress and results shown in
the status bar. A missing runtime dependency (Node, for the npm-sourced
servers) is checked and reported clearly only when you actually try to
install something that needs it, not required upfront for languages that
don't.

**Real diagnostics, hover, autocomplete, and formatting** — a working LSP
feature set, not just the installer: opening a file with an installed
server for its language automatically starts that server in the
background — no separate step — and:
- Real errors/warnings show up as colored spans right in the text, the
  same rendering pipeline syntax highlighting already uses.
- `K` in Normal mode shows real hover info (type signatures, docs) in a
  popup anchored near the cursor.
- Typing a trigger character the server recognizes (e.g. `.` for Go) pops
  up real completion candidates in Insert mode — browse with
  `<C-n>`/`<C-p>`, confirm with `<Enter>`.
- `:Format` reformats the buffer using the server's own formatter.

Powered by a hand-rolled LSP client (`internal/lspclient`) that speaks
real JSON-RPC to the server over its own stdin/stdout — every one of the
features above verified against an actual running `gopls`, not simulated.

## Present — known gaps in what's above

- **Visual mode isn't reachable** — no key enters it yet.
- **No macros or incremental search** — `/`-style search is queued
  (`ATOMIC_TASKS.md`'s T31); macros aren't scoped yet at all. (Registers
  and yank/paste, listed as a gap here previously, shipped 2026-10-11 —
  see Present above.)
- **The GUI's hover/completion popup position is an approximation, not
  pixel-exact** — Gio's text rendering here doesn't track real pixel
  coordinates for the cursor, so the popup's position is estimated from
  font size, not measured. The terminal version doesn't have this
  limitation (terminal cells are exact by nature).
- **Go-to-definition** is a further, separate plan again, since it also
  needs multi-buffer/workspace support that doesn't exist yet.

## Past — how it got here

- Started as a piece-table experiment (`internal/piecestore`), built as a
  small standalone package before the rest of the editor existed.
- Grew into a full editor shape: the piece table was hardened and renamed
  to `internal/piecetable`, and cursor/position math was extracted into its
  own layer (now `internal/viewmanager` + `internal/offset`).
- The first keybinding engine (`internal/editor/keymap`) was a crude,
  from-scratch first pass — vim-style verb/modifier/noun sequences, but
  every delete-family binding (`x`/`dd`/`dw`/`diw`) collapsed onto the same
  non-directional "backspace" primitive, and Visual mode was entirely
  unreachable.
- That engine was fully replaced (not repaired) by `internal/keyengine`,
  built on an explicit "action + offset" model: every keybinding reduces to
  a motion/text-object *resolving* an offset or range, and a verb *applying*
  an action to it — the same resolver is reused whether a noun is reached
  after an operator (`dw`) or pressed standalone as a motion (`w`).
- The GUI was rebuilt to route through that same engine instead of its own
  hand-rolled keybindings, closing the GUI/TUI parity gap — plus three real
  Gio input-routing bugs found and fixed along the way (a tag needing an
  explicit focus filter to ever receive typed text, bare Tab being a
  reserved system key, and a wildcard key filter silently rejecting every
  Ctrl-combo).
- `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` and the arrow keys turned out to have been missed
  entirely when the engine was rebuilt — found live, by actually using the
  editor day to day, not by inspection.
- Real syntax highlighting and tree-based auto-indent landed the same day,
  after a deliberate architecture review (undo/redo edit-deltas → a real
  `ChangeChan` payload → a styled-rendering contract → language detection)
  and a from-scratch prototype to validate the tree-sitter library choice
  before committing to it.
- Bracket and quote auto-pairing landed after that, plus a real bug found
  live in daily use (`h`/`j`/`k`/`l` had no keybinding table entries at
  all) and fixed the same day.
- The LSP installer/manager (`:LspInstall` and friends) is the first piece
  of actual LSP work, split into a deliberate 3-plan sequence (installer →
  client+features → go-to-definition/multi-buffer) rather than one large
  undertaking. Its design was grounded in real, empirically-verified data —
  a live fetch of mason-registry's actual published schema, not an assumed
  one — the same "verify before committing" discipline the tree-sitter
  library choice used.
- A single long session (2026-10-17) shipped real yank/delete/change/paste
  through a clipboard register (named registers, a `:register` overview),
  real find/replace (`:s///`/`:%s///` with live match highlighting and a
  confirm-flag walk), and a UX polish pass (a real terminal cursor shape,
  line numbers, command-name completion) — the project's most
  feature-dense single day yet; see `CLAUDE.md`'s Current phase for the
  full account.

## Future — staged, not all planned in equal detail

This section absorbed `VIM_ACTION_CHECKLIST.md` and `IDE_FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md`
in full (2026-10-17) — both are now deleted rather than kept as a second,
inevitably-drifting copy of this same information (a real staleness problem
already caught once before merging: a prior audit found
`VIM_ACTION_CHECKLIST.md` claiming `y`/`p`/`P`/named registers/short-delete/
`x`/counted operators were all still missing well after they'd shipped).
Everything below was re-verified against the real current code before
merging, not copied forward from either checklist's own checkboxes.
`ATOMIC_TASKS.md` stays a separate, deliberately different document — this
section is the stable plan of record (the roadmap), `ATOMIC_TASKS.md` is the
ordered, pick-up-anytime queue pulling from it (plus real bugs/polish found
along the way) — the two aren't meant to merge into one.

Governing rule throughout, unchanged from before: keep later stages in mind
architecturally so nothing forecloses them, but don't build them until
reached.

### Stage 1 (MVP) — reached

GUI/TUI parity is real, both front ends route through the same engine.
Real yank/delete/change/paste, find/replace, and the October UX-polish pass
(cursor shape, line numbers, command completion) all landed after Stage 1
closed, so "MVP" undersells what's actually here now — see Present above.

### Stage 2 (current) — markdown/HTML + treesitter/LSP

**Shipped**: real tree-sitter highlighting/indent across 15 languages, and
a complete LSP feature set (install, diagnostics, hover, autocomplete,
formatting) verified against a real `gopls`. What's left:

- **Mode-based markdown rendering** (`ATOMIC_TASKS.md`'s **T42**) — raw
  source in Insert, rendered (conceal-style) in Normal/Visual/Command. This
  is now the chosen answer to this section's own long-open "is preview a
  narrow pane or the first real multi-pane" question — neither:
  mode-conditional rendering of the same buffer. A browser-based live
  preview (the `peek.nvim` shape, from the dotfiles research) was the other
  real option on the table and is superseded by this choice, not pursued
  separately.
- **Treesitter-powered text objects** (`ATOMIC_TASKS.md`'s **T43**;
  function/class/argument/conditional/loop — `if`/`af` etc.) — builds
  directly on the parse trees already kept per buffer for highlighting/
  indent, not starting from zero. Matches `mini.ai`'s custom-textobjects
  config from the dotfiles research.
- **Smarter `%` bracket/tag matching** (**T44**; treesitter-aware, beyond
  bare bracket counting — the `vim-matchup` idea from the dotfiles
  research) — same infra reuse as above.
- **Richer completion sources** — buffer-word completion blended with the
  existing LSP+path sources (the `blink.cmp` idea from the dotfiles
  research); today's completion is LSP-or-path only. Deferred as
  **T45**, pending real design signal (see `ATOMIC_TASKS.md`).
- **LSP feature extensions**, natural extensions of the already-working
  client: signature help (**T46**), inlay hints (**T47**, deferred —
  shares T42's column-math problem, piggybacks on its mechanism rather
  than inventing a second one), semantic highlighting (**T48**; LSP
  semantic tokens layered over tree-sitter's syntactic highlighting),
  organize-imports/auto-import on completion (**T49**). Code actions/
  quick-fixes stay explicitly deferred as "Part 4," per `CLAUDE.md` —
  restated for completeness, not a new idea.
- **The GUI popup-position approximation** (**T50**; hover/completion
  anchored by estimated font metrics, not real pixel coordinates) — a
  known, accepted limitation, worth real op-recording if it's ever
  visually off enough to matter.
- **Format-on-save** (**T51**, behind a `:set` toggle — not everyone wants
  it) — trivial given `:Format` already exists; just needs a save-time
  hook (the `conform.nvim` autocmd idea from the dotfiles research).

### Cross-cutting — pick up anytime, not gated by any stage

The biggest bucket, because most of vim's own grammar and most of "boring
IDE infra" genuinely don't depend on multi-buffer or full-IDE scope —
they're just not built yet.

**Vim grammar, remaining gaps** (verified against real `keyengine`/
`interpreter`/`offset`/`executor` code, not assumed):
- Capital "to end of line" verb variants (`D`/`C`/`Y`) and the rest of
  `ATOMIC_TASKS.md`'s **T33-T38** batch (`0`/`$`/`^`/`t`/`T`/`W`/`B`/`E`,
  `X`/`a`/`s`/`S`/`I`/`A`, `~`/`gu`/`gU`/`g~`/`J`/`gJ`, `gg`/`G`/`{`/`}`/
  `;`/`,`/`gi`, bracket/quote/tag text objects, `>`/`<`/`=`) — already
  queued, not repeated here in full.
- `t`/`T` (till-character) and `;`/`,` (repeat last find) — **confirmed
  still unbuilt**, even though bare `f`/`F` already work as motions
  (verified: wired through `interpreter`/`offset.MotionFindCharForward`/
  `Backward` and `dispatch.go`'s `pendingFindChar`). One real nuance worth
  knowing before building `df{char}`: `f`/`F` only resolve as bare motions
  today, not as text-object-style nouns — an operator+find combination
  (`df{char}`) doesn't work yet even though the bare motion does.
- `:s///`'s `i`/`I` case-override flags — **confirmed still unbuilt**; `g`
  and `c` are both done.
- Register system, remaining nuances: numbered registers `"1`-`"9` — the
  underlying history data already exists (each category register keeps up
  to 9 entries), but nothing addresses it by number yet, only the unnamed
  default (`p`) and lowercase named (`"ap`) — a narrower gap than "numbered
  registers don't exist" sounds like. Special registers (`"%`/`"#`/`".`/
  `":`/`"/`), the black-hole register (`"_`), the expression register
  (`"=`), and real OS clipboard integration (`"+`/`"*` — confirmed nothing
  wires to the system clipboard today, only the internal register system)
  are all still genuinely unbuilt. **Appending to a register (`"A`) is a
  deliberate non-goal, not a gap** — lowercase-only was an explicit product
  decision (T24: "I didn't even know vim had an uppercase named register.
  lowercase is enough").
- Marks (`a`-`z` lowercase; uppercase/global marks need Stage 3's
  multi-buffer first), the jumplist (`Ctrl-O`/`Ctrl-I`) and changelist
  (`g;`/`g,`), `gi` (resume Insert at last exit point).
- `/`/`?` search with incremental highlighting, `n`/`N`, `smartcase`/
  `ignorecase` — **`ATOMIC_TASKS.md`'s T31** already queued and scoped
  (reuses T29's highlight mechanism, uses `<C-n>`/`<C-p>` instead of real
  vim's `n`/`N` for consistency with this codebase's existing "these two
  keys cycle whatever's active" convention). `*`/`#` (search word under
  cursor) and `gn`/`gN` (operate on next match, e.g. `cgn`) are natural T31
  follow-ons, not scoped yet.
- Command-line power tools: ranges (`:5,10`, `:%`, `:'a,'b`) as their own
  small composable addressing language, `:g/pattern/cmd`/`:v` (global/
  inverse-global — one of vim's most GUI-equivalent-free features),
  `:normal {keys}`, `:sort`, `:!{cmd}`/`:r !{cmd}`/`:{range}!{cmd}`,
  user-defined Ex commands (`:command`). Ex command *history* (distinct
  from command-*name* completion, which is done — see `ATOMIC_TASKS.md`'s
  **T32**).
- Macros (`q{reg}`/`@{reg}`) — worth remembering they're not a separate
  mechanism, just registers holding recorded keystrokes as editable text,
  which is why registers had to come first.
- Undo beyond linear: the undo tree itself (vim's undo isn't a stack —
  `g-`/`g+` walk time, both branches of a diverged edit stay reachable, a
  real data-structure difference from today's linear model), `:earlier`/
  `:later`, and persistent undo (`undofile` — survives closing/reopening a
  file; the dotfiles research flagged this as a real daily habit).
- **`.` (dot-repeat)** — small, outsized effect on real vim fluency; most
  "vim feels fast" anecdotes trace back to compose-once-repeat-with-`.`
  rather than re-typing or reaching for a mouse.
- Insert mode's remaining mini-language: `Ctrl-W`/`Ctrl-U` (delete back a
  word/to insertion start), `Ctrl-R {reg}` (paste mid-insert), `Ctrl-O`
  (one Normal command without a full mode round-trip), `Ctrl-T`/`Ctrl-D`
  (indent/dedent the line), `Ctrl-K`/`Ctrl-V` (digraph/literal-char entry).
- Small, easy-to-forget things: `Ctrl-A`/`Ctrl-X` (increment/decrement a
  number), `~` (toggle case + advance — part of T35's batch), `:iabbrev`,
  `:mksession`, diff mode (`vimdiff`/`:diffthis`, `do`/`dp`).
- Mappings & discoverability: custom key mappings (`:map`/`:nnoremap`,
  recursive-vs-non-recursive, the four separate mode namespaces),
  operator-pending-mode mappings, and a **`which-key.nvim`-style live
  discoverability popup** (from the dotfiles research) — a direct
  complement to `ATOMIC_TASKS.md`'s **T39** (T39 is the static, browsable
  version; this is the live, in-context one).
- `mini.surround`-style add/change/remove a wrapping pair (dotfiles
  research) — a genuinely new verb category, no dependencies either way.
- Remaining modes, lower-priority-but-real (not cut, see Out of scope
  below for the ones that are): Replace mode (`R` — typing overwrites
  instead of inserting) and the command-line window (`q:`/`q/`/`q?` — the
  command history opened as an editable buffer instead of a one-line
  prompt, depends on T32's command history existing first).
- Checkbox toggle, quick-capture/worklog, and mode-based markdown rendering
  are already their own queued tasks — **T40/T41/T42** — not repeated here
  (T42 also appears above under Stage 2, since it resolves that stage's own
  open preview question).

**IDE-shell infra, not gated by a stage**:
- **A real config file** — flagged specially: it's a dependency hub (theme,
  keybinding remap, per-language settings all sit on top of it), not just
  one more checklist line, and small ad hoc state is already accumulating
  without it (`:set`'s two boolean options today, T41's proposed notes-path
  setting) that would benefit from consolidating before it sprawls further.
- **Reliability & data-safety correctness gaps** worth weighting above pure
  features, since they undermine the "real daily-driver" pitch directly:
  graceful handling of invalid UTF-8, grapheme-cluster-correct cursor
  movement (not just UTF-8-rune-correct — combining accents, most emoji,
  some CJK can otherwise get split visually in two), IME support (a real,
  separate input-handling mode, not something "handle key events" gives for
  free in either Gio or the terminal).
- **File & buffer handling** — a few worth pulling forward over the rest of
  this category, since they're the same bug *class* already caught once by
  accident (`:e`'s missing dirty-check, found while scoping T41): file-
  changed-on-disk detection, confirm-before-close in the GUI (`:q` already
  refuses on unsaved changes; closing a window/tab by mouse has no
  equivalent check), crash recovery/autosave. The rest — encoding
  detection, line-ending/BOM handling, binary-file detection, read-only/
  permission handling, symlink handling, single-instance awareness,
  auto-save-on-timer, local history, trim-trailing-whitespace-on-save,
  `.editorconfig` support — anytime, lower urgency.
- **Mouse support** — click-to-move, drag-to-select, scroll wheel, double/
  triple-click word/line select. Easy to undercount as "boring infra"
  rather than a feature; a huge fraction of real-world editing muscle
  memory depends on it existing at all, in both frontends.
- Navigation/editing conveniences with no stage dependency: go-to-line/
  symbol (a smaller piece than full go-to-definition, splittable from it),
  document outline/breadcrumbs, code folding (tree-sitter-based folding
  specifically reuses the same parse trees as indent/highlighting), the
  quickfix/location-list mechanism (what a future diagnostics panel or
  problem-matcher would actually be built on, in vim's own terms), move/
  duplicate/join/sort lines, comment toggle (tree-sitter-aware, same
  per-language-table shape as auto-indent's `indentContainerTypes`), case
  conversion, Smart Home/End, snippets (ties to the dotfiles research's
  `mini.snippets`/`blink.cmp`).
- **A `trouble.nvim`-style diagnostics panel** — an aggregated, sortable
  list over data (`DiagnosticSpans`) that already exists — this is a UI,
  not new backend work.
- Startup/lazy-load work (grammars/LSP servers loaded only for languages
  actually opened) — anytime, no gate.
- **Very-large-file (500MB-class) stress testing** — deliberately placed
  here, not up front with Stage 1: performance has stayed a real priority
  at every step so far (the O(log n+k) syntax-span fix, viewport-bounded
  rendering/LSP sync everywhere), so this isn't a known failure to chase
  down, just an untested assumption worth confirming eventually. The
  whole-buffer `CombinePieces()` calls sprinkled through LSP sync/
  formatting are the one concrete thing worth checking first whenever this
  is picked up.

### Stage 3 — multi-file/workspace

Close to a direct restatement of what "Stage 3" already meant, now with the
dotfiles research and the old IDE checklist's "Project & workspace
management" category folded in rather than listed separately:

- A file tree/project explorer (the `oil.nvim`/`fyler.nvim` shape from the
  dotfiles research), file create/rename/delete/move from the UI (with LSP
  `willRenameFiles` reference updates where a server supports it).
- Tabs for open buffers + splits/panes, vim's own windows/tabs/buffers
  model (`Ctrl-W` splits, `:tabnew`/`gt`/`gT` — a vim tab is a *layout of
  splits*, not "one file" the way browser tabs work, worth keeping that
  distinction rather than copying the browser-tab mental model; `:ls`/
  `:bnext`/`:bprev`/`Ctrl-^` for the actual buffer list).
- Session/workspace restore (vim's own `:mksession` is the native version
  of this), multi-root workspaces, per-project vs. global settings (a
  `.pieces-store/`-style project-local config layered over global
  preferences — depends on the config-file work above existing first).
- `mini.pick`-style fuzzy files/grep/buffers UI (dotfiles research) — the
  front-end for the already-planned ripgrep-style workspace search; the
  buffers picker specifically needs the multi-buffer model to mean
  anything. File icons (`nvim-web-devicons`) are cosmetic, riding along
  once a picker/tree exists to decorate.
- Go-to-file, project-wide search & replace (scoped search, `.gitignore`-
  aware, safe replace-all with a diff-style preview), workspace-wide symbol
  search (LSP `workspace/symbol`), find references (LSP
  `textDocument/references`) — all depend on the workspace model existing.
- **Rename symbol** (LSP `textDocument/rename`) and **call/type hierarchy**
  — both genuinely workspace-wide/multi-file by nature, so they land here
  rather than Stage 2 despite otherwise being "just" LSP feature
  extensions.
- Version control integration as a block: git status gutter (now has a
  directly reusable shape from T28's viewport-bounded `GutterWidth` sizing
  approach — a diff-marker column is the same kind of problem), inline
  blame, a diff viewer (ideally with merge-conflict 3-way resolution),
  stage/commit/push from inside the editor, `.gitignore`-aware file tree
  and search. A `neogit`-level full Git porcelain UI (dotfiles research) is
  a legitimate but much bigger ask inside this — worth its own deliberate
  yes/no when this stage is actually reached, not folded in by default.
- Uppercase/global marks (`A`-`Z`) — explicitly depend on multi-buffer
  (jumping to one opens the file if it isn't already open).
- An embedded terminal panel, a configurable task runner (`Taskfile`/
  `package.json`-scripts-style project commands surfaced in a future
  command palette), an output/log panel distinct from the terminal,
  problem matchers (parsing build-tool output into clickable diagnostics).
- Workspace trust/safe-mode prompt — relevant the moment any of the above
  (task-runner config, a plugin API) means running project-defined code on
  file-open.

### Stage 4 — full IDE

Unchanged in substance from before, now with the dotfiles research's
real-world confirmation folded in rather than treated as new scope:

- **Debugging** (breakpoints, step in/over/out, variable inspection, watch
  expressions, call stack, conditional/remote breakpoints) — the Debug
  Adapter Protocol (DAP) is the realistic path, the debugging equivalent of
  LSP, rather than hand-rolling per-language integration. The dotfiles
  research's `nvim-dap`/`dap-ui`/`neotest`/`mason-nvim-dap` stack (plus
  per-language test adapters) is real-world confirmation this is a genuine,
  used-daily feature set, not a hypothetical — it doesn't move the scope,
  just validates it.
- Background workspace indexing (project-wide symbol/reference indexing
  independent of any single open buffer — a different, heavier thing than
  today's per-buffer LSP session model), multi-root/multi-server LSP
  awareness (two projects with different `gopls` configs open at once), and
  LSP workspace configuration (`workspace/configuration`,
  `didChangeConfiguration` — `gopls` and friends support real per-project
  settings; nothing sends any today).
- Per-language tooling (the dotfiles research's `flutter-tools.nvim`/
  `go.nvim` shape) — premature before broader language support itself
  matures, naturally lands here rather than earlier.
- A real plugin/scripting API (Lua, in the spirit of Neovim) — explicitly
  out of scope for now per `CLAUDE.md`; the architecture is deliberately
  built so this becomes possible later without a second, separately-
  designed API, mirroring Neovim's own RPC surface serving both external
  GUIs and Lua plugins. Autocommands (`BufWritePre`/`BufEnter`/
  `InsertLeave` event hooks) are arguably half of what a plugin API needs
  to expose, and are themselves still unbuilt. User-defined snippets and
  macro persistence (saved across sessions, not just for the current one)
  are smaller extensibility pieces riding on the same eventual API.
- Two "modern nvim, not stock vim" primitives worth naming for when a
  plugin API is eventually designed, not before: **extmarks** (buffer
  positions carrying metadata that survives edits around them — a general
  version of what `viewmanager.DiagnosticSpan` already does narrowly for
  diagnostics; most future "gutter marker" features — git status,
  bookmarks, breakpoints — would end up sharing this under the hood instead
  of each inventing their own), and **`vim.ui.select`/`vim.ui.input`** (one
  seam for "a UI needs to ask the user something," instead of N different
  plugin-specific prompts). Floating windows, nvim's other major modern
  primitive, are effectively already present in spirit — the hover/
  completion popups are the same idea, independently built rather than
  inherited from a plugin ecosystem that doesn't exist here.

### Later than full IDE — shipping concerns, not feature-stage-gated

Orthogonal to the Stage 1-4 axis entirely — relevant once there's a real
product being shipped to other people, independent of how feature-complete
it is:

- Accessibility & internationalization: screen reader support (worth a
  dedicated Gio investigation whenever picked up — immediate-mode GUIs
  historically lag retained-mode toolkits here), high-contrast themes, UI
  string localization (everything is English-only/hardcoded today),
  right-to-left text support.
- Cross-platform & packaging: installers/packages per platform, an
  auto-update mechanism, code signing/notarization, the already-documented
  npm-installed-LSP-server Windows shim gap.
- Project infrastructure: CI (none exists — `go vet`/`go test` are run by
  hand today), cross-platform automated testing (this project's dev loop is
  Linux-first; Mac/Windows are stated targets with presumably zero current
  coverage on real hardware), crash reporting, a real release/versioning
  process.
- A real settings UI, keybinding remapping, a theme system (today's Tokyo
  Night palette is hardcoded per frontend), font configuration
  (GUI-specific), per-language settings beyond global tab width — all sit
  on top of the config-file work above once it exists.

### Out of scope / deliberately cut

- An in-editor HTTP client (`curl.nvim` shape, dotfiles research) — a
  different app, not a text-editor feature.
- Obscure vim modes low-priority even by the source checklist's own
  admission: Select mode (`gh`/`gH`/`gv`), Virtual Replace mode (`gR`).
  Terminal mode (nvim-specific) depends on an embedded terminal panel
  existing first (Stage 3), so it's gated, not cut.

---

**A note on scale** (carried forward from the old `IDE_FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md`'s
own closing note, since it's still exactly true): several of the categories
above — debugging via DAP, background workspace indexing, a plugin API, full
accessibility support — are each easily as large as everything built so far,
combined. That's not a reason to avoid listing them; it's genuinely what
"full IDE" costs everywhere, just paid for by much bigger teams elsewhere.
The *editor* core (Stage 1-2, largely done) and the *IDE shell* around it
(most of Stage 3 onward) are different-sized problems, and it's fine —
probably correct — to spend a long time being a great editor before being a
complete IDE shell.
